            <p>
                To prevent bots or trolls to ruin the Secret Santa party, we need the list organizer <b>%ownername%</b> to validate his or her participation. We''ve sent a mail to <b>%owneremail%</b> with further instructions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once validated, your Secret Santa list will be scrambled and all users will receive your message along with the name of their Secret Santa gift buddy.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the validation e-mail the list organizer will also find a link to keep track of all users in their Secret Santa list who''ve already found out their gift buddy. Making sure every Secret Santa knows his duty.

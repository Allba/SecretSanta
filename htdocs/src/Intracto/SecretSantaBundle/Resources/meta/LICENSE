Basically, you can use the SecretSanta code under the ISC license below.

The design is not free though. You are not allowed to (re-)use or
(re-)distribute it. The simple reason for this is that this is not our work. We
had to buy this design and the license is restrictive. Sorry. If you have a
free design, we will consider accepting your pull request. ;-)
